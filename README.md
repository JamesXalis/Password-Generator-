# Strong Random Password Generating Function

## Description

### **This repository includes javascript functions that generate a randomized password based on user selected criteria**

### Developing the main function

The application is creating a function that can take user prompts and develop a password accordingly. My biggest motivation for this was to develop my skills with functions in general and different methods that can be applied to arrays.  

 From there, a series of prompts will confirm what criteria must be met for the generated password.
